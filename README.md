# **AI-Based Traffic Management System**

This project uses **Artificial Intelligence** to manage and optimize traffic flow at intersections. It adjusts traffic signal timings in real-time based on vehicle density and reduces congestion.

## 💡 **Features**
- **Real-time traffic monitoring**
- **Dynamic signal control using AI**
- **Reduced waiting time and fuel consumption**
- **Scalable to multiple intersections**

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for video processing)
- **Machine Learning** (for traffic prediction)
- **Flask** (for web interface, if any)

## 📁 **How to Run**
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## **Run the project:**
